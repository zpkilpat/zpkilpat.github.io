<u><h2>APPM 4370/5370: Projects</h2></u>
<font size="2">Below I provide a list of papers, each of which could form the basis of a project in this course. You may choose your own
	paper, but must discuss this with me ahead of time. As stated on the syllabus, by Fri Mar 20 at 11am, you must hand in a one page proposal
	telling me the paper you've chosen, the mathematical work and computational experiments you will perform, and the research question(s)
you will ask and answer. I encourage you to come talk to me as you're developing your proposal, so you can be sure to identify
	interesting and realistic goals for your project. The proposal should list the members of the project group: undergrads work in groups of three,
grad students work in twos. Each group only needs to submit one proposal. In all class periods from Wed Apr 8 to Fri Apr 24, you
will spend time working on your project, and I will circulate through groups to answer questions. Also expect to devote significant time outside of
class working on your project.  <br> <br>
By Mon Apr 27 at 11am, you will hand in your final report and be ready to give a 15 minute
slide talk (e.g. Powerpoint, Keynote, or beamer). As part of the project report you must thoroughly read the paper (several times), summarize it,
recreate two results figures, and create two new results figures which are extensions of the work in the paper. This should
be presented as a 10-15 page research paper (or jupyter notebook) with an introduction, methods, results,
and discussion section. <br> <br>
<b>Introduction:</b> Provide a detailed summary and motivation of the work in the paper (2-3 pages). <br>
<b>Methods:</b> Explain in detail the mathematical model the paper examines, defining all terms, and provide
some details on the mathematical methods they use, and any new methods you will use to extend results in your
	paper (2-3 pages). <br>
	<b>Results:</b> Recreate two results figures in the paper and explain what they mean and then produce two new figures
	which are interesting extensions of the results already presented in the paper. Provide a detailed explanation of
	what all the plots you provide mean and explain what you learn from them (4-6 pages). <br>
	<b>Discussion:</b> Provide a neurobiological interpretation of your findings from the paper and suggest any future studies
	or analyses that would be interesting to consider (2-3 pages). <br>
	The goals for the project are for you to learn about ongoing research in computational neuroscience, demonstrate understanding of its
	value, and gain experience asking/answering your own relevant research questions.
	The paper should demonstrate you have done all this. <br> <br></font>
